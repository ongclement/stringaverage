# TDD Practice

You are given a string of numbers between 0-9. Find the average of these numbers and return it as a floored whole number (ie: no decimal places) written out as a string. Eg: "zero nine five two" -> "four"
If the string is empty or includes a number greater than 9, return "n/a"

Implement the above method/function in your familiar programming language, include unit tests and push the code to github for me to review by the above deadline.
